This was a relatively easy chapter. It didn't take me too long to finish.

But the multiplication chapter took me until the next day since it was too late in the night for me to focus. 

The problem with this one was that I didn't know how to make a proper timeout. So after a bit of googling I found the perfect solution to my problems. 

Indeed using the pyinputplus in the example project was easier but doing it without those features was refreshing and helpful to improving my critical thinking.
