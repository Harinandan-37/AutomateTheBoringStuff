This chapter was a difficult one since it was completely new to me. But I was introduced to a useful website in the early stages of my googling. 

However the truly difficult project among them is the regexsplit. I'm still working on that. I managed to write a code that could remove the spaces without using the re module. But its difficult to find a way to remove the characters that are passed as argument.

The other tasks were difficult as well, but I managed to build a code around the problems and they seem to work.
