The only hard project was ZombieDice. I had missed the main part of the question and had wasted some time on searching what the question wanted me to do.

And in the last question, the code bot wasn't winning any of the simulations. So I was convinced that something was wrong with my code and wasted time on it.
That was until I realised that it was like that for a lot of people.
Aside from that it was not hard. 

The chapter project mclip is still a bit unclear to me. I have done everything according to instructions and there is no mistake in the code. My setup was perfect as well. However the text I wanted copied to the clipboard wouldn't copy. I shall do my best to fix that.
