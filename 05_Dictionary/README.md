This chapter was a bit unique since I knew about dictionaries but never had used them to much of an extent. 

The Fantasy Game Inventory had me in a bit of a pinch. Especially the addToInventory function. It was not difficult. But I had made a very small mistake and that made me waste quite some time on it. Otherwise it was an easy task.
The ChessDict and others were easy.
