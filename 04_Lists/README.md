The tasks were not difficult considering I knew a few things about lists before.
It involved some thinking in manipulating lists.

Conway's Life was a unique concept to me but not totally new since I could still relate the application of lists here to the application of arrays in CS50 Week 4.

Coin Flip Streak took me a moment since I had misinterpreted the question. Nevertheless it was not that hard either.
